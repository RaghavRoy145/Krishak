        <h1>What is Krishak</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Agriculture in India dates back to the Indus valley civilisation and even before
            that in some parts of southern India.
            It is, by a huge margin, the highest employing field in the country, and even so, the methods adopted by the
            employees
            in this field remains primitive.<br><br>
            The average farmer is plagued by debt, bad crop yield because of inefficient means and methods, and even
            subsistence is
            a arduous task every day.
            <br><br>
            With Krishak, we are bringing the world of e-commerce and information to farmers.
            Our aim is to put a check on mis-information, and propagate efficient methods in agriculture.</p>
